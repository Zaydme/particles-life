Particles apply forces on each others. Each color applies a predefined attraction/repulsion force on every other color inside a predefined radius.
*The attraction/repulsion forces are different every time you run the script.*

There is a basic mode, that has only 2 colors, red and blue, red attracts red and repulses blue, blue attracts blue and repulses red. To turn on basic mode click `toggle basic mode`
or make your own preset
