Particles apply forces on each others. Each color applies a predefined attraction/repulsion force on every other color inside a predefined radius.
*The attraction/repulsion forces are different every time you run the script.*

There is a FUN mode, with Corona virus and red blood cells, this will help you understand better. To turn on FUN mode click `toggle fun mode`
or make your own preset
